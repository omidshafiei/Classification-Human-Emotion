# Classification-Human-Emotion
Using SVM (support-vector machine) algorithm to classify human emotion from EEG signals
## Description
In this project, the emotions are detected using EEG signals. We have employed Support Vector Machine (SVM) which is one of the Machine Learning techniques to classify EEG data into two different emotions; happiness and sadness. The accuracy of recognizing happiness and sadness emotions are 79.5% and 83 % respectively.
